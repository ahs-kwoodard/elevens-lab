	Exercise II
		1. A card is an object that is stored within the deck. The deck serves as storage for
		each of these card objects.
		2. 3
		3. String[] ranks = {"Ace", "2,", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9",
            "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"};
			String[] suits = {"Spades", "Hearts", "Clubs", "Diamonds"};
			int[] values = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10};
		4. Yes, if the elements are inserted out of order, the cards will not be created correctly
		because the data type may not match or the contents of the array would not make sense in
		the context of whatever parameter it is placed within.
		5. 
		
	Exercise III
		1. 
		
			import java.util.Random();
		
			public static String flip() {
				Random r = new Random();
				String coin;
				int outOfThree = r.nextInt(3);
				
				if (outOfThree == 0 || outOfThree == 2) {
					coin = "heads";
				} else {
					coin = "tails";
				}
				
				return coin;
			}
			
		2.
			public static arePermutations(int[] ar1, int[] ar2) {
				for(int i = 0; i < ar1.length; i++) {
					for(int x = 0; x < ar2.length; x++) {
						if (ar1[i] == ar2[x]) {
							return true;
						} else {
							return false;
						}
					}
				}
			}
			
		3. 0, 0, 1
		
	Activity 6
		1. 5 of Clubs and 6 of Spades, 5 of Spades and 6 of Clubs
		2. Yes, because the amount of face cards of each suit are equivalents between Kings, Queens
		and Jacks. This is also supported with the fact that if the amount of face cards are subtracted
		from the deck, the deck is left with an even number. Therefore with three cards remaining, they
		must be face cards.
		3. The game does not involve strategy. The occurences within it happen due to chance and you cannot
		strategically plan on which play to make.
